        "output": "You should provide reasoning for each step.\nStep 1:  First, we need to find out how far John travels in the first 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour. We can calculate this by multiplying the speed by the time, which gives us $60 \\times 3 = 180$ miles.\nStep 2:  Next, we know that John travels at a speed of 30 miles per hour for half an hour before increasing his speed to 80 miles per hour. We need to find out how far he travels in the remaining 2 hours at the increased speed.\nStep 3:  To do this, we first calculate the distance traveled in the first half hour at 30 miles per hour, which is $30 \\times 0.5 = 15$ miles.\nStep 4:  Then, we calculate the distance traveled in the remaining 2 hours at 80 miles per hour, which is $80 \\times 2 = 160$ miles.\nStep 5:  Now, we need to find the total distance traveled by John in the 4 hours. We add the distance traveled in the first 3 hours (180 miles) to the distance traveled in the last half hour (15 miles) and the distance traveled in the last 2 hours (160 miles). This gives us a total distance of $180 + 15 + 160 = 355$ miles.\nStep 6:  Finally, we need to find the distance from John's home. We can do this by subtracting the total distance traveled from the initial distance. Since John was 60 miles away from home when he started, the distance from his home is $60 - 355 = -295$ miles.\nStep 7:  However, since distance cannot be negative, we take the absolute value of the distance, which is $|-295| = 295$ miles.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{295}$ \nThis solution is based on the assumption that the distance cannot be negative. Therefore, the final answer is the absolute value of the calculated distance. \n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{295}$ \nThis solution is based on the assumption that the distance cannot be negative.

        "output": "Step 1: The number of downloads in the first month is given as 60.\nStep 2: In the second month, the number of downloads is three times the number of downloads in the first month. So, the number of downloads in the second month is 60 * 3 = 180.\nStep 3: In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30% from the number of downloads in the second month. To calculate the decrease, we need to find 30% of 180. This is 180 * 0.3 = 54.\nStep 4: Now, we need to subtract the decrease from the number of downloads in the second month to get the number of downloads in the third month. This is 180 - 54 = 126.\nStep 5: To find the total number of downloads in three months, we need to add the number of downloads in each month.

        "output": "Let's start solving the request.\nLet's assume that the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with is x.\nSince Melanie sold 1/3 of the vacuum cleaners in Green House, she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners in Green House.\nShe sold 2 vacuum cleaners in Red House.\nShe sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in Orange House, which is (x - x/3 - 2)/2 = (2x - x - 4)/2 = x/2 - 2 vacuum cleaners in Orange House.\nThe number of vacuum cleaners Melanie has left is 5.\nSo, the equation becomes: x - x/3 - 2 - (x/2 - 2) = 5.\nSimplifying the equation, we get: x - x/3 - 2 - x/2 + 2 = 5.\nCombine like terms: x - x/3 - x/2 = 5.\nMultiply both sides by 6 to eliminate fractions: 6x - 2x - 3x = 30.\nCombine like terms: x = 30.\nThe final answer is: 30. \nAnswer: 30.

She took 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles, and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. \nStep 2: To find her average speed, we need to calculate the total time taken and the total distance covered so far. \nStep 3: The total time taken so far is 2 hours, and the total distance covered is 6 miles (4 + 2). \nStep 4: To find her average speed, we divide the total distance covered by the total time taken. \nStep 5: Her average speed is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour. \nStep 6: However, her target average speed is 4 miles per hour. \nStep 7: To find the required speed for the remaining distance, we need to calculate the total time she has to cover the remaining distance. \nStep 8: The total distance is 12 miles, and she has already covered 6 miles, so the remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. \nStep 9: Since her target average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. \nStep 10: We know the distance (6 miles) and the speed (4 miles per hour), so we can rearrange the formula to find the time: time = distance / speed. \nStep 11: Plugging in the values, we get: time = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours. \nStep 12: Since she has already taken 2 hours to cover the first 6 miles, she has 1.5 - 2 = -0.5 hours left to cover the remaining distance. \nStep 13: However, since time cannot be negative, we need to rethink our approach. \nStep 14: Let's calculate the time she has left to cover the remaining distance. \nStep 15: She has already taken 2 hours to cover the first 6 miles, so she has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to cover. \nStep 16: Since her target average speed is 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. \nStep 17: We know the distance (6 miles) and the speed (4 miles per hour), so we can rearrange the formula to find the time: time = distance / speed. \nStep 18: Plugging in the values, we get: time = 6 miles / 4 miles per hour = 1.5 hours. \nStep 19: However, we are looking for the speed, not the time. \nStep 20: To find the speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. \nStep 21: We know the distance (6 miles) and the time (1.5 hours), so we can plug in the values to find the speed. \nStep 22: Speed = 6 miles / 1.5 hours = 4 miles per hour. \nStep 23: However, this is the average speed, and we are looking for the required speed. \nStep 24: To find the required speed, we can use the formula: speed = distance / time. \nStep 25: We know the",

        "output": "There are 10 liters of a drink that is two-thirds water. I have to add it to 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. But when I pour it, I pour out 1 liter of the drink. In the remaining 24 liters, how much water is there?\nStep 1:  The first step is to determine the amount of water in the 10 liters of the drink that is two-thirds water. This can be calculated as 10 * (2/3) = 20/3 liters.\nStep 2:  Next, we need to find the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple drink that is three-fifths water. This can be calculated as 15 * (3/5) = 9 liters.\nStep 3:  When we pour the 10 liters of the drink into the 15 liters of pineapple drink, we pour out 1 liter of the drink. So, the total amount of liquid left is 10 + 15 - 1 = 24 liters.\nStep 4:  To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to add the water from the two drinks and then subtract the amount of water that was poured out.\nStep 5:  Adding the water from the two drinks, we get 20/3 + 9 = 59/3 liters.\nStep 6:  Since 1 liter was poured out, we need to subtract 1 from the total water content to get the final amount of water in the remaining 24 liters.\nStep 7:  Subtracting 1 from 59/3, we get 58/3 liters.\nStep 8:  To convert this to a decimal, we divide 58 by 3, which gives us 19.33 liters.\nStep 9:  Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is 19.33 liters.\n\nThe final answer is: $\\boxed{19.33}$ Answer: 19.33. \nI hope it is correct.

So, we can write the equation: 7x + 11x = 162\nStep 3: Simplifying the equation, we get: 18x = 162\nStep 4: Dividing both sides by 18, we get: x = 9\nStep 5: Now that we know the value of x, we can find the current age of Alan, which is 11x = 11(9) = 99\nStep 6: Since the problem asks for Alan's age 10 years from now, we need to add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109\n\nAnswer: 109. \nThe final answer is 109.

Since the first friend says there are 80 jelly beans, we don't need to do any calculation for this step.\nStep 2: The second friend says there are 20 more than half of the first friend's guess. We need to find half of 80 and add 20 to it. Half of 80 is 80/2 = 40. Adding 20 to it gives us 40 + 20 = 60.\nStep 3: The third friend says there are 25% more than the first friend's guess. We need to find 25% of 80 and add it to 80. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. Adding 20 to 80 gives us 80 + 20 = 100.\nStep 4: To find the average of the three friends' guesses, we need to add up all their guesses and divide by 3.

This means he spent $30 on buying more LEGO sets.\nTotal money spent on buying more LEGO sets = Total money from selling LEGO sets - Total money left\nTotal money spent on buying more LEGO sets = 195 - 35\nTotal money spent on buying more LEGO sets = 160\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of LEGO sets John bought with the $30.\nNumber of LEGO sets bought = Total money spent on buying more LEGO sets / Price per LEGO set\nNumber of LEGO sets bought = 160 / 15\nNumber of LEGO sets bought = 10.67\n\nStep 6: Since John cannot buy a fraction of a LEGO set, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John bought 10 more LEGO sets.\nNumber of LEGO sets bought = 10\n\nStep 7: Calculate the number of LEGO sets John still has.\nNumber of LEGO sets left = Initial number of LEGO sets - Number of LEGO sets bought\nNumber of LEGO sets left = 13 - 10\nNumber of LEGO sets left = 3\n\nAnswer: 3.  (Note: This answer is based on the assumption that John cannot buy a fraction of a LEGO set.)  If John can buy a fraction of a LEGO set, then he would have 10.67 LEGO sets left.  However, the problem statement does not specify this, so the answer is 3.  If you want to include the decimal part of the number of LEGO sets, the answer would be 10.67.

The only known weapon that can defeat the dragon is a golden head that can knock the dragon out of the air, and it is 400 feet away from the dragon's flames. However, when Polly picks up the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the golden head three times farther than before. If Polly picks up the sapphire gemstone, how far away from the dragon can she stand and still hit the dragon with the golden head?\n\n## Step 1: First, let's determine the distance Polly can throw the golden head when she doesn't have the sapphire gemstone.\nThe golden head can be thrown 400 feet away from the dragon's flames.\n\n## Step 2: Next, let's calculate the distance Polly can throw the golden head when she has the sapphire gemstone.\nSince the sapphire gemstone allows Polly to throw the golden head three times farther than before, the distance she can throw the golden head is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.\n\n## Step 3: Now, let's determine the distance Polly can stand away from the dragon and still hit the dragon with the golden head.\nSince the dragon's flames can reach 1000 feet, Polly can stand 1000 feet away from the dragon and still hit the dragon with the golden head when she has the sapphire gemstone.\n\n## Step 4: However, Polly can throw the golden head 1200 feet away, so she can stand even farther away from the dragon and still hit the dragon.\nThe distance Polly can stand away from the dragon is 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet more than 1000 feet.

        "output": "(e.g., Answer: 5)\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\nStep 1: First, let's calculate the total number of tukda (pieces) of pia (pia) that आजी जोन्स (Aaji Jones) had. She had 5 pia and each pia was cut into 8 pieces. So, the total number of pieces is 5 * 8 = 40.\n\nStep 2: Now, let's calculate the number of pieces that were left after the guests ate some. There were 14 pieces left.\n\nStep 3: To find out how many pieces the guests ate, we need to subtract the number of pieces left from the total number of pieces. So, the number of pieces eaten by the guests is 40 - 14 = 26.\n\nStep 4: Since each pia was cut into 8 pieces, we need to divide the number of pieces eaten by the guests by 8 to find out how many pia they ate. So, the number of pia eaten by the guests is 26 / 8 = 3.25. Since we cannot have a fraction of a pia, we will round down to the nearest whole number, which is 3.\n\nStep 5: Finally, we need to find out how many pieces the guests ate.

Since 1800 calories have already been consumed, we can subtract 1800 from 2000 to find out the remaining calories needed.\n2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left\n\nStep 4: Since there are 0.1667 calories per gram, we can divide the remaining calories needed by the calories per gram to find out how many grams of chips are needed.\n200 calories / 0.1667 calories per gram = 1200 grams\n\nStep 5: Since there are 5 parts in a 300-gram bag, we can divide the total grams needed by 5 to find out how many 300-gram bags are needed.\n1200 grams / 300 grams per bag = 4 bags\n\nThe final answer is: 1200\nAnswer: 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग्रॅम. 1200.0 ग",

(If he sells each candle for $2.00 and makes 20 candles, how much profit will he make?)\n\nNow, let's solve the problem step by step:\n\nStep 1: Calculate the cost of making 20 candles.\nचार्ली 20 मेणबत्त्या तयार करण्यासाठी 20/10 = 2 पौंड मधमाशी वापरतो. (He uses 2 pounds of wax to make 20 candles.)\nCost of 2 pounds of wax = 2 x $10.00 = $20.00 (The cost of 2 pounds of wax is $20.00.)\n\nStep 2: Calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles.\nचार्ली 20 मेणबत्त्या विकण्यासाठी 20 x $2.00 = $40.00 कमावतो. (He earns $40.00 from selling 20 candles.)\n\nStep 3: Calculate the profit.\nProfit = Revenue - Cost\n= $40.00 - $20.00\n= $20.00\n\nThe final answer is: $20.00. \nAnswer: $20.00.
